# DSH Mobile

[中文](README.md) · **English**

A phone client for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) running on
your own computer: watch what your agent is doing, answer its questions, and keep a session going
while you are away from the desk.

The phone talks to your computer through a small relay. Nothing about your code or conversations is
stored on the relay — it forwards frames and keeps daily byte counters.

## What you need

1. **DSH on a computer** (the desktop half of the product). Sessions live there; the phone is a
   remote control and a reader.
2. **The connector plugin**, which runs inside DSH:
   `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-mobile-link`
3. **The app**, from TestFlight:
   <https://testflight.apple.com/join/tHKQsbCk>
   (The App Store release is in review. TestFlight builds expire after 90 days and need a manual
   update in the TestFlight app.)
4. **An invite code.** The relay is invite-only while it is in early use. Codes are handed out in
   [issue #1](https://github.com/jayantTang/DSH_Mobile/issues/1) — one code enrolls one computer,
   and the issue is written in Chinese today.

## Pairing

On the computer, click **移动端连接** at the bottom of the sidebar in DSH: the panel shows the QR
code, the pairing code and how long it stays valid. Scan it in the app (**Scan QR code**); if the
camera is unavailable, the same panel shows the code to type by hand.

Once paired, the app lists that computer's sessions. It works the same way as the desktop client:
open a session to read its transcript, type to continue it, and answer whenever the agent asks for
approval or a choice.

## Privacy

- Conversations travel phone → relay → your computer, over TLS.
- The relay does not persist message content. It keeps device rows, invite state, and per-day byte
  counters (see [`relay/README.md`](relay/README.md)).
- The phone keeps a local cache in `Caches` (session list metadata, the tail of sessions you have
  opened, downloaded pictures). It is not backed up, expires after 30 days, and can be cleared in
  **Settings → Cache**. Conversation *content* is stored in the clear on the device — clear it if
  you hand the phone to someone else.
- Prefer to keep everything on your own hardware? The relay can be self-hosted; the repository
  includes the server, the systemd unit, and the Caddy snippet.

## Status

Early, and honest about it: the client is used daily by its author, a handful of testers are on
TestFlight, and the app's interface is being translated — the main paths (connect, session list,
transcript, settings) are in English, while longer screens are still Chinese.
