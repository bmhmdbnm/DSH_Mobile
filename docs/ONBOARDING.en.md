# After installing: how to use it

[中文](ONBOARDING.md) · **English**

Two ways to get the phone talking to your computer. Pick one before you start —
they differ only in who runs the relay.

## What you need first

1. **DSH running on your computer** (the desktop half of the product).
2. **The connector plugin**, installed into that DSH:
   `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-mobile-link`
3. **The app on your phone**, from TestFlight:
   <https://testflight.apple.com/join/tHKQsbCk>

## A · Use the existing relay (5 minutes)

1. **Install the app** from the TestFlight link above.
2. **Install the connector** on your computer (step 2 above), then keep DSH running.
3. **Enrol this computer with an invite code.** Claim one from
   [issue #1](https://github.com/jayantTang/DSH_Mobile/issues/1) — one code enrols one computer,
   and the connector prints the enrolment command when it starts without an identity.
4. **Restart DSH** so the connector picks up its new identity. After that it reconnects by itself.
5. **Pair the phone:** click **移动端连接** at the bottom of the sidebar in DSH and scan the QR
   code it shows; the relay address and the one-time pairing code are both inside that code, so
   nothing has to be typed. (With no GUI around, `node scripts/dev/show-pair-qr.mjs` prints the
   same code as an image.)
6. **Check the link:** the app's status chip turns green and the session list fills in.

## B · Run your own relay (20 minutes)

The repository ships the relay, its systemd unit and a Caddy route snippet.

```bash
# on your server (root, with Caddy already installed)
git clone https://github.com/jayantTang/DSH_Mobile.git && cd DSH_Mobile
DSH_RELAY_SITE=your.host DSH_RELAY_BASE_PATH=/dsh-link relay/deploy/deploy.sh

# create an account and mint yourself an invite code
/opt/dsh-relay/.venv/bin/python /opt/dsh-relay/admin.py \
  --db /var/lib/dsh-relay/state.db invite-mint --note "first computer"
```

Then enrol the connector against your own relay address instead of the shared one. Details, including
the Caddy snippet and the systemd sandbox, are in [`relay/README.md`](../relay/README.md).

## What you can do once paired

- Read any session's transcript, including tool calls and their output.
- Answer whenever the agent asks for approval or a choice — the phone is often faster than walking
  back to the desk.
- Keep a session going: type, send pictures, stop a run.
- Browse the session's workspace files and its git changes.
- Get a notification when a run finishes or when something needs you.

## When it will not connect

Check in this order:

1. Is DSH still running on the computer, with the connector loaded?
2. Does the phone have network access, and can it reach the relay?
3. Is the pairing still valid? Revoke and pair again if the device was revoked on the computer.
4. Self-hosted relay: is Caddy up, and does the path in `DSH_RELAY_BASE_PATH` match the client's
   relay address?

## Uninstall / change relay

```bash
# switching relays: drop the old identity, then enrol again
rm ~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json

# removing the connector
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-plugin-mobile-link
```

On the phone, revoke this phone in **Settings → Paired devices**, or just delete the app.
