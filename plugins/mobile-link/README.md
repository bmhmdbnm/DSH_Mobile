**The computer half of [DSH Mobile](https://github.com/jayantTang/DSH_Mobile): it
dials a relay over WSS, so the native iOS client reaches this DSH instance even
though the computer has no public IP.**

```
iPhone App ──WSS──▶ Relay（公网，只鉴权与转发）──WSS──▶ this plugin ──HTTP+WS──▶ 127.0.0.1:<port>
```

The connector always talks to the local DSH as `127.0.0.1:<port>`, so the host's
authority and its trust fence are unaffected: no `--trusted-host`, no rewritten
`Host`, no new listening port on this machine.

## Install

The connector runs in whichever host runs your DSH. There are two supported hosts today —
**the official desktop app** and **the command-line web host** — and each keeps its own
profile, so you install the plugin into the one you actually use. The connector discovers
the local DSH by itself in both (the host hands it the authenticated loopback address);
you never type an address or a token.

**Command-line web host**

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-mobile-link
```

**Official desktop app** — install through the app's own plugin page, or with the CLI that
the app ships (`…/Resources/runtime/cli/bin/dsh`, installable from its settings). The npm
`dsh` refuses this profile on purpose (`profile "desktop" is managed exclusively by the
Electron application`). Two prerequisites matter in practice: let the app start once so it
initializes its profile, and **quit it completely** before installing — otherwise the
profile is locked.

```bash
# quoting the app's bundled CLI; see docs/ONBOARDING.md for the section titles
"<DeepSeek Harness.app>/Contents/Resources/runtime/cli/bin/dsh" \
  plugin --profile desktop add dsh-plugin-mobile-link
```

Then restart the host (or reload the profile). From a checkout the same command takes
a path — the leading `./` matters, because DSH anchors a relative spec against
your current directory instead of resolving it inside the profile:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add ./plugins/mobile-link
```

## Use

1. Register this computer with a relay (once). Either redeem an invite code:

   ```bash
   dsh-mobile-link enroll --invite <邀请码> --relay wss://<你的站点>/dsh-link
   ```

   …or register it on the relay host with `relay/admin.py agent-register
   --write-config ~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json`.

2. Mint a pairing code, and show it as a QR the phone camera can read:

   ```bash
   dsh-mobile-link --mint-pair-code        # prints JSON: code + relay + agentId
   ```

   Or open the **移动端连接** panel at the bottom of the sidebar in the DSH client
   (spec 010) — same code, same QR, with the validity countdown.

3. Scan it in the iOS app. After that the phone reconnects on its own — nothing
   else has to be run by hand.

`GET /mobile-link/status` reports whether the link is up, which devices are
attached, and whether this computer is registered yet.

## Configuration

All optional; the defaults are what a stock deployment needs. Set them in the
plugin's config block (`cordis.patch.yml`), not by editing this file.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | `false` stops the outbound link without uninstalling |
| `relayUrl` | from `agent.json` | Relay base URL; a bare deployment dials `<relay>/link/agent` |
| `agentId` / `agentSecret` | from `agent.json` | Override the enrolled identity |
| `stateFile` | `~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json` | Where the identity lives |
| `dshUrl` | discovery | Explicit local DSH base URL (usually unnecessary — the host hands the connector its own address) |
| `heartbeatMs` | `20000` | DLP ping interval |

The connector does **not** read an endpoint handoff file any more: discovery happens inside
the host process (`ctx.inject(['webServer','connection'])`), which is what makes one npm
package work on both the desktop app and the command-line host. It **writes** one instead —
`$DSH_HOME/mobile-link/endpoint.json`, mode 0600 — for tools that run *outside* the host
(our dev/test scripts and the iOS integration helpers).

Address resolution order: this config block, then `DSH_RELAY_URL` (or
`DSH_MOBILE_LINK_RELAY`), then the enrolled identity file, then the repository
placeholder `wss://relay.example.com/dsh-link` — the placeholder being the
"nothing configured yet" sentinel rather than a real address.

## Design notes

- **No required services.** `inject` is empty and the routes are attached through
  `ctx.inject([...])`, so a future DSH that renames or drops `webServer` /
  `connection` cannot make the tunnel fatal on boot.
- **Protocol-transparent.** Nothing outside `lib/` is imported and no DSH
  business API is touched: the connector forwards frames, it does not interpret
  sessions. The relay has the same property.
- **Disable** by removing the row from the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, or by
  setting `enabled: false`.

## Test

```bash
cd plugins/mobile-link && npm test    # zero dependencies
```
