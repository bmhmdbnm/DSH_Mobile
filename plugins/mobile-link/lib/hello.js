 * path, and the direct path is not what users run.
 *
 * Feature detection, not version comparison: a connector that lacks a
 * capability simply does not list it, and the app hides that entry instead of
 * calling something that would come back as a 404 from the Host.

 * Capabilities the app may rely on.
 *
 * - `file-transfer`  files can be staged on the computer (see files.js)
 * - `events`         the per-device `$events` stream is served
 * - `session-streams` logical streams (`session/follow`, …) are served
 * - `pair-code`      this connector can mint a pairing code on request
 * - `qr-pairing`     this connector can render the pairing QR itself
 *                    (`GET /mobile-link/qr`), so the desktop needs no client
 * - `self-enroll`    this connector can register itself with an invite code
 * - `git`            git status / diff / log / show can be read from the work
 *                    tree on this computer (see git.js)
 * - `background-transfer`
 *                    this connector speaks the `fsPut*` / `fsGet*` bridge frames,
 *                    so the app may **send and fetch** large files over the
 *                    relay's HTTPS surface with a background URL session instead
 *                    of the WebSocket. An app that does not see this falls back to
 *                    the WSS path — which is why adding the capability is the
 *                    *only* switch the client needs.
