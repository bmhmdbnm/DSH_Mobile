# DLP relay — DSH Link Protocol v1

> 面向：部署与运维方 · 状态：stable · 最近核对：2026-09-20

A small Python 3.12 + aiohttp relay that lets an iOS client reach a DSH instance behind NAT. Both
the connector (`../plugins/mobile-link/`) and the phone dial out to it; it authenticates both sides
and forwards frames by `agentId`, never parsing DSH semantics.

Normative specification: [`../docs/RELAY-PROTOCOL.md`](../docs/RELAY-PROTOCOL.md).
Where the implementation had to make a judgement call, it is written down in
[`RELAY-NOTES.md`](../docs/RELAY-NOTES.md).

```

    │                                  │                          └────────────┘
```

The public endpoint is a **path prefix on an existing, already-certified site**
(`https://relay.example.com/dsh-link`) — no new DNS record and no new
certificate. Caddy's `handle_path /dsh-link/*` strips the prefix, so the relay
itself keeps serving root-relative routes; it also accepts the un-stripped
`/dsh-link/...` form (via `--base-path`), so it works behind either kind of
front end.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `relay.py` | aiohttp wiring: the two WebSocket endpoints, the app factory, base path, CLI entrypoint |
| `api.py` | plain-HTTP surface: `/healthz`, `/stats`, `/pair/{claim,refresh,code}`, CORS, bearer parsing |
| `dlp.py` | frame codec, validation, additive relay control frames |
| `store.py` | SQLite persistence (accounts, agents, devices, pair codes), hashes only |
| `hub.py` | agent/device registry, routing, per-device backpressure |
| `admin.py` | operator CLI (accounts, agents, pairing codes, devices) |
| `deploy/` | systemd unit, Caddy route fragment, `caddy_splice.py`, idempotent `deploy.sh` |
| `tests/` | pytest unit tests, `integration_e2e.py` (the full middle-tier run) and its `e2e_support.py` helpers |

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | — | `{"ok":true,"version":1}` |
| `GET` | `/stats` | — (loopback only) | operator view: live load, effective limits, egress per device. JSON, or an HTML page when the client sends `Accept: text/html` |
| `WS` | `/link/agent?agentId=<id>` | `Bearer <agentSecret>` | one live connection per `agentId`; a new one supersedes the old (close `4001`) |
| `WS` | `/link/device?agentId=<id>` | `Bearer <deviceToken>` | up to `--max-devices-per-agent` per agent (past it: an `error` frame `limit/devices`, then close `4012`) |
| `POST` | `/pair/claim` | — | `{pairCode, deviceName, deviceModel, appVersion}` → device token |
| `POST` | `/pair/refresh` | device token | rotates the token; the old one dies immediately |
| `POST` | `/pair/code` | agent secret | mints a one-time pairing code (see `docs/RELAY-NOTES.md` §2) |
| `POST` | `/agents/enroll` | invite code | redeems a one-time invite for `agentId`/`agentSecret` (closed: no valid invite, no identity) |
| `GET` | `/devices` | device token | the caller's own pairings |
| `POST` | `/devices/revoke` | device token | revokes one of the caller's own pairings |
| `OPTIONS` | `*` | — | CORS preflight |

Every path above is served **both** as `/healthz` and as `/dsh-link/healthz`
(configurable with `--base-path`), which is what makes the relay indifferent to
whether the front end strips the prefix.

## Quick start (local, no server)

```bash
cd relay
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# provision an account + agent, and write the PC identity file
.venv/bin/python admin.py --db state.db account-create --name "Example"
.venv/bin/python admin.py --db state.db agent-register \
    --account acc_xxx --name "MacBook Pro" \
    --relay ws://127.0.0.1:8787 --write-config ~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json

# run the relay (add --base-path /dsh-link to mimic the production mount)
.venv/bin/python relay.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --db state.db

# mint a pairing code for the phone
.venv/bin/python admin.py --db state.db code-mint --agent agt_xxx

# let somebody else's computer register itself (one code per computer)
.venv/bin/python admin.py --db state.db invite-mint --note "for Sam"
```

The invitee then runs the connector's own enrollment on their machine, which
calls `POST /agents/enroll` and writes `~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json`:

```bash
dsh-mobile-link enroll --invite <code> --relay wss://relay.example.com/dsh-link
```

That is the whole distribution story: the operator mints codes, and nobody has
to hand a credential around. Enrollment is deliberately *not* open — the relay
is on the public internet, so an invite is the only way in.

`code-mint` prints the code plus a `dsh://pair?relay=…&code=…` deep link — that
is the string to render as a QR code.

## Tests

From the repository root:

```bash
relay/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q                                 # relay unit tests, no network
                                                                    # (条数以 pytest --collect-only -q 为准)
                                                                    # (Caddy validation tests skip without a caddy binary)
relay/.venv/bin/python relay/tests/integration_e2e.py               # full middle tier vs the real local DSH
DSH_E2E=1 relay/.venv/bin/python -m pytest relay/tests -q           # unit + end-to-end under pytest
```

The integration run starts a real relay, provisions through `admin.py`, runs the
real Node agent against the local DSH instance, and drives a fake device through
`session/list`, `$events`, `session/follow` and a reconnect. It only touches
read-only DSH endpoints.

## Operations

### Provisioning

```bash
A=.venv/bin/python  # or /opt/dsh-relay/.venv/bin/python on the server
DB=/var/lib/dsh-relay/state.db

$A admin.py --db $DB account-create --name "Example"
$A admin.py --db $DB agent-register --account acc_x --name "MacBook Pro" \
      --relay wss://relay.example.com/dsh-link --write-config ~/.dsh/mobile-link/agent.json
$A admin.py --db $DB code-mint --agent agt_x                 # 10-minute, one-time
$A admin.py --db $DB agent-list
$A admin.py --db $DB agent-rotate --agent agt_x              # new secret, same agentId
$A admin.py --db $DB agent-disable --agent agt_x
$A admin.py --db $DB device-list --agent agt_x
$A admin.py --db $DB device-revoke --device dev_x            # or --token dt_x
$A admin.py --db $DB purge                                   # drop expired codes
$A admin.py --db $DB usage --days 7 --by account             # 最近 7 天的出口用量
```

`device-revoke` 只写库——**库里撤销即完成**。在线设备由中转自己的对账踢下线，最长一个
对账周期（`DLP_REVOKE_RECONCILE_S`，默认 5 秒；`0` = 关）；连接器在它下次连上时会被告知
放下那台设备的记录。`--device` 与 `--token` 的结果因此完全相同——`admin.py` 是另一个进程，
够不着 relay 的 hub，拿被撤对象的令牌去打 relay 也只会得到 401（`device_by_token` 对已撤销
令牌返回 None），所以那条直连路径已经删掉，不再有第二条会漂移的实现。

### Daily usage accounting

`usageDaily` 一天一台设备一行：出口字节、连接次数、当天最后上报的构建号。
记账点只有一个（`DeviceLink._count_egress`），累加在内存里，**每 30 秒或累计 1 MiB
冲一次盘**，另外在设备断开、跨本地日、进程收尾时各冲一次——所以账最多丢最后一次
冲盘前的那点字节，一次正常的重启（systemd stop/start）不丢。

口径：**日界是服务器本地日**（`store.local_day()`，回答"今天"）。设备每日额度
（`DailyQuota`）用的是**同一个**函数——额度基线就是这张表里 `(deviceId, 今天)` 那一行的
`egressBytes`，所以"今天用了多少"和"今天还剩多少"永远是同一件事。这张表只记中转自己
转发的字节，不含 SSH、OTA 下载和主机上的其它流量。

```bash
$A admin.py --db $DB usage --days 7 --by device    # 按设备
curl -s localhost:8787/stats | python3 -m json.tool | head -40   # 今天的汇总（含未冲盘部分）
```

`agent-register --write-config` writes `agent.json` with mode `0600`. Run it as
*your* desktop user so the file lands in your own home directory. The pairing
code is shown as `XXXX-XXXX` plus a `dsh://pair?relay=…&code=…` QR payload.

### Deploying to the relay host

```bash
export DSH_RELAY_SITE=<your.site>        # 仓库里只有占位符，真值在你自己的环境里
sudo -E relay/deploy/deploy.sh           # enable or update; safe to re-run
sudo -E relay/deploy/deploy.sh --uninstall  # revert the Caddy change
journalctl -u dsh-relay -f
```

`deploy.sh` 的 `DSH_RELAY_SITE` 默认值是占位符 `relay.example.com`——站点地址属于
部署方，不进仓库。`DSH_RELAY_URL` / `DSH_OTA_HOST` 同理，见仓库根的
`.env.example`。

`deploy.sh` creates a `dsh-relay` system user, builds a venv under
`/opt/dsh-relay`, installs the sandboxed unit, and splices a marked
`handle_path /dsh-link/*` route **inside the existing `relay.example.com`
site block** of `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` — before the first `handle` /
`handle_path` / `route` / `reverse_proxy` directive, so the site's own catch-all
`handle` block can never swallow it. It then runs `caddy validate`, and only
reloads Caddy if the configuration is valid; on failure it restores the original
file byte for byte. Finally it health-checks the loopback port (both path forms)
and `https://relay.example.com/dsh-link/healthz`.

Nothing else in the Caddyfile is rewritten, reordered or deleted.

**Enabling / reverting the Caddy change**

* Enable: `sudo relay/deploy/deploy.sh` (or re-run it after an edit).
* Revert: `sudo relay/deploy/deploy.sh --uninstall`, which removes the unit and
  the marked block and reloads Caddy. The SQLite database and `/opt/dsh-relay`
  are left in place.
* Manual revert: delete the marked block from `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`, i.e.
  everything from
  `# >>> dsh-relay managed block (managed by relay/deploy/deploy.sh) >>>`
  through
  `# <<< dsh-relay managed block <<<`,
  then `caddy validate --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile --adapter caddyfile` and
  `systemctl reload caddy`.
* `python3 relay/deploy/caddy_splice.py check /etc/caddy/Caddyfile` reports
  whether the block is present; `… remove` takes it out.

Overridable: `DSH_RELAY_USER`, `DSH_RELAY_DIR`, `DSH_RELAY_DATA`,
`DSH_RELAY_PORT`, `DSH_RELAY_SITE` (default `relay.example.com`),
`DSH_RELAY_BASE_PATH` (default `/dsh-link`), `DSH_RELAY_PYTHON`, `CADDYFILE`.

### Configuration

| Flag / env | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` / `DLP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | bind address (Caddy terminates TLS) |
| `--port` / `DLP_PORT` | `8787` | bind port |
| `--db` / `DLP_DB` | `relay/state.db` | SQLite path |
| `--pair-ttl-seconds` | `600` | pairing-code lifetime |
| `--device-ttl-days` | `365` | device-token lifetime |
| `--queue-depth` | `512` | per-device backpressure bound |
| `--max-devices-per-agent` / `DLP_MAX_DEVICES_PER_AGENT` | `0` (unlimited) | how many devices one agent may keep attached; a reconnect never counts twice |
| `--device-rate-kbps` / `DLP_DEVICE_RATE_KBPS` | `0` (no pacing) | per-device egress pacing, in **kilobits per second** |
| `--device-daily-mb` / `DLP_DEVICE_DAILY_MB` | `0` (unlimited) | per-device egress allowance per **local** day, in megabytes; the count is read from `usageDaily`, so a reconnect or a restart does not reset it |
| `--base-path` / `DLP_BASE_PATH` | *(empty)* | optional mount prefix; every route is served with and without it |
| `--log-level` / `DLP_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | log verbosity |

### Why the three limits exist (and how to pick numbers)

The relay is normally deployed on a **fixed-bandwidth** host, and that bandwidth is
shared by every device on it. The limits are not about abuse — they are about one
perfectly ordinary session not ruining everybody else's:

* **`--device-rate-kbps`** — a device that downloads ten screenshots moves ~27 MB
  of egress. On a 5 Mbps pipe that is 43 seconds of the *entire* link. Pacing one
  device at, say, 2 Mbps leaves the rest of the pipe for everyone else, and the
  device itself only sees a slower picture, never a dropped frame: the writer
  sleeps and streams, it does not discard. Pick roughly *pipe ÷ expected
  simultaneous heavy devices*, not *pipe ÷ devices*.
* **`--device-daily-mb`** — pacing bounds how fast, this bounds how much. A device
  that spends its allowance is closed with code **`4011`** after being told why
  (`{"t":"error","code":"quota/device-daily"}`), and may connect again after local
  midnight. The count comes from `usageDaily`, so it is the day's total rather
  than the connection's: reconnecting, or a relay restart, continues where it left
  off. Set it to a comfortable multiple of a heavy day (a few hundred MB) rather
  than to a typical day.
* **`--max-devices-per-agent`** — one computer, one person. This is what stops a
  leaked device token (or a pairing script) from filling the relay with sockets
  that all multiplex onto one connector. A device reconnecting is counted once,
  so a phone can never lock itself out. A refusal is delivered as a DLP `error`
  frame (code `limit/devices`) on an accepted socket followed by a clean close
  with code **`4012`**, not as a bare HTTP `403` — the phone can then tell the
  person the host is full.

### Watching the load

`GET /stats` returns the relay's own accounting — live agents and devices, the
effective limits, and egress bytes per device since the process started:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8787/stats | python3 -m json.tool | head -40
# or open http://127.0.0.1:8787/stats in a browser (through an SSH tunnel) for a
# self-refreshing page: agent/device counts, total egress, per-device bytes,
# how many seconds each device spent paced, and the remaining daily allowance.
```

The host's own interface counters cannot answer "which device is using the
bandwidth" — they mix in SSH, OTA downloads and everything else on the machine.
These numbers are the relay's, so they can.

### Security posture

* Secrets are generated with `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` and stored **hashed**:
  SHA-256 for tokens, scrypt (`n=2^14`) for the short human-typed pairing codes.
* `/pair/claim` is throttled per client IP (10 failures / 5 minutes) and scrypt
  verification is capped at 2 concurrent calls, so a claim flood cannot burn the
  CPU.
* The systemd unit runs as a dedicated user with `NoNewPrivileges`,
  `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp`, a syscall filter and
  exactly one writable path (`/var/lib/dsh-relay`).
* The relay listens on loopback only; TLS and the public hostname are Caddy's job.

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| device never gets `hostStatus online:true` | is the agent connected? `journalctl -u dsh-relay -f` logs `agent <id> connected` |
| `401` on the device WebSocket | the device token is unknown, revoked, or expired (`admin.py device-list --all`) |
| `pair/invalid-code` | no such code: mistyped, or older than the classification window |
| `pair/used-code` | the code was already claimed — one code pairs one device; a second phone needs a fresh one |
| `pair/expired-code` | the code outlived its TTL (10 minutes by default); mint a new one |
| a rejected claim, and which code it was | the log line names the reason and, when the code matched a row, when it was minted / used / expired — `journalctl -u dsh-relay \| grep 'pair claim rejected'` |
| device is dropped every few seconds | it is not draining frames; the relay closes on 512 queued frames (code `4008`) |
| device stops receiving mid-session, close code `4011` | it spent its daily allowance (`--device-daily-mb`); the frame before the close is an `error` with code `quota/device-daily` |
| a device feels slow but nothing is dropped | it is being paced (`--device-rate-kbps`); `GET /stats` shows the seconds each device spent waiting |
| a second phone cannot connect at all (`limit/devices` / close `4012`) | `--max-devices-per-agent` is reached; raise it or revoke a pairing (`admin.py device-revoke`) |
| phone shows "host offline" repeatedly | the agent is reconnecting; check its `lastError` via `GET /mobile-link/status` or `MOBILE_LINK_STATE` lines |
| `https://relay.example.com/dsh-link/healthz` is 404 | the marked block is missing from the right site block; run `caddy_splice.py check` then `deploy.sh` |
| `admin.py device-revoke` 之后手机还连着 | 等一个对账周期；仍连着就看 `journalctl -u dsh-relay` 有没有 `was revoked in the database but still connected; detaching`——没有就是 `DLP_REVOKE_RECONCILE_S=0` 或对账任务挂了（日志里有 `revoke reconcile tick failed`） |
| WebSockets close every 30–60s through Caddy | `read_timeout`/`write_timeout` were overridden; they must stay `0` (no timeout) in the reverse_proxy transport |

### Database

```sql
accounts(accountId, name, createdAt)
agents(agentId, accountId, name, secretHash, createdAt, updatedAt, disabled, lastSeenAt)
devices(deviceId, deviceTokenHash, agentId, accountId, name, model, appVersion,
        createdAt, expiresAt, lastSeenAt, revokedAt)
pairCodes(codeHash, agentId, accountId, createdAt, expiresAt, usedAt, deviceId)
usageDaily(day, deviceId, agentId, accountId, egressBytes, connections,
           firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt, lastBuild)
invites(codeHash, createdAt, expiresAt, usedAt, usedByAgentId, note)
```

Back up by copying `state.db` (plus `-wal`/`-shm`) with the service stopped, or
use `sqlite3 state.db ".backup /path/backup.db"`.
