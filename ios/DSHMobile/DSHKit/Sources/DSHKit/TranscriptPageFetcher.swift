/// Turns "give me the page before seq N" into one `TranscriptPager.Page`, over

///
/// Why this lives in the protocol package and not in the chat model: choosing a
/// channel and normalising two different answers into one shape is the part that
/// can be tested without a UI, and it is where the old code went wrong — the
/// legacy channel's shortfall was "corrected" by arithmetic in the middle of the
/// view model, and when the arithmetic ran out the session was marked finished.
///
/// **Exact channel** (`history-window` capability): the connector returns a page
/// that abuts the window by construction, and `clamped` tells the phone when the
/// log was trimmed instead.
///
/// **Legacy channel**: the Host's `session/page` with the published workaround —
/// ask again with the measured shortfall, at most `maxAttempts` times. This
/// channel *cannot promise* abutment even after correcting (that is the defect
/// 007 exists for), so its pages are marked `clamped` as well. The pager then
/// accepts the gap and the app tells the reader the connector should be upgraded
/// (FR-041) instead of refusing to page forever.
